Nov 15 - Nov 21
After our project proposal was approved by our mentor, we met up to decide the basic
structure of the program, including using the DFS traversal, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm,
and the between centrality algorithm. Thus, our task for this week is to build up an overall
skeleton of the program. However, it should be noted that not everything is finalized yet.
Changes can still be made in the future as we progress.

Nov 22 - Nov 28
We finished implementing the function which can transform the csv data of airports into a vector of airports. 
We half finished the make matrix function. We finished all of its helper functions. 
We learned how to write Makefile and is still writing it. 

Nov 29 - Dec 5
We started on the DFS traversal. 
The team met with the TA and discussed how traversal will need to have something that will store all the nodes that it walked thru and it will also be looked at for grading. 
We also asked about visualizing the graph and were told that it will count as the uncovered algorithm and the team decided to stick with the original plan.

Dec 6 - Dec 13
We finished DFS traversal/ bewteenness and findcentralairport
Starting to debug, test, write makefile and play with our function.
